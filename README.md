# 📘 README – Kansas Businesses Scraping Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project extracts business information for Kansas from **Enigma Business Directory**.

The pipeline works in two stages:

1. **Link Scraping** – Collects website links for the given category: `{category}`.
2. **Business Scraping** – Visits each website and extracts:
   - Business Name
   - Email(s)
   - Phone Number
   - Website
   - Address
   - Source URL
   - Category

Final structured output is saved as:  
**{output_file}**

---

## 📂 Deliverables
1. **Python Script(s)**  
   - `kansas_scraper.py` → End-to-end scraper for links + details.

2. **Excel Files**
   - `kansas_businesses.xlsx` → Raw scraped links.  
   - `{output_file}` → Final output with detailed business info.

3. **README File (this file)**  
   - Describes sources, missing categories, and challenges.

🌐 Websites / Sources Used
Enigma Business Directory
{source_url}

🚨 Missing Categories / Limitations
Some categories may not have enough businesses listed.

Some businesses hide emails → fewer results.

If less than 10 businesses are found, the output file includes a note:
"Less than 10 record available for this category".

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Dynamic content loading (JavaScript not supported by BeautifulSoup).

Hidden or obfuscated emails (e.g., info [at] company dot com).

Duplicate business entries.

Websites blocking scrapers → required User-Agent headers.

Different page structures across sites.
